Barbarian was a very interesting movie to say the least. At times it had me on the edge of my seat while other times I was playing on my phone waiting for the next part of the movie. They had many good actors in it and for the most part I enjoyed all of them but I feel like some actors were wasted during the moveie. The movie is extremely funny and had me crying from how funny different parts were. Although this is a hard movie to recommend I do not regret watching it.
